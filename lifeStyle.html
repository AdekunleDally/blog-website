      <p>Lifestyle is the interests, opinions, behaviours, and behavioural orientations
          of an individual, group, or culture.[1][2] The term was introduced by Austrian
          psychologist Alfred Adler with the meaning of "a person's basic character as 
          established early in childhood".[3] For example, in his 1929 book "The Case 
          of Miss R.". The broader sense of lifestyle as a "way or style of living" 
          has been documented since 1961.[3] Lifestyle is a combination of determining
          intangible or tangible factors. Tangible factors relate specifically to 
          demographic variables, i.e. an individual's demographic profile, whereas 
          intangible factors concern the psychological aspects of an individual such 
          as personal values, preferences, and outlooks.
          A rural environment has different lifestyles compared to an urban metropolis.
          Location is important even within an urban scope. The nature of the neighborhood
          in which a person resides affects the set of lifestyles available to that person
          due to differences between various neighborhoods' degrees of affluence and 
          proximity to natural and cultural environments. For example, in areas near the
          sea, a surf culture or lifestyle can often be present.
     </p>
     <p> A lifestyle typically reflects an individual's attitudes, way of life, 
         values, or world view. Therefore, a lifestyle is a means of forging a 
         sense of self and to create cultural symbols that resonate with personal identity.
          Not all aspects of a lifestyle are voluntary. Surrounding social and technical 
          systems can constrain the lifestyle choices available to the individual and the 
          symbols she/he is able to project to others and the self.[4]
         The lines between personal identity and the everyday doings that signal a particular
          lifestyle become blurred in modern society.[5] For example, "green lifestyle"
           means holding beliefs and engaging in activities that consume fewer resources
            and produce less harmful waste (i.e. a smaller ecological footprint), and 
            deriving a sense of self from holding these beliefs and engaging in these
             activities.[6] Some commentators argue that, in modernity, the cornerstone 
             of lifestyle construction is consumption behavior, which offers the possibility
              to create and further individualize the self with different products or services
               that signal different ways of life.[7]
            Lifestyle may include views on politics, religion, health, intimacy, and more.
             All of these aspects play a role in shaping someone's lifestyle. [8] In the
              magazine and television industries, "lifestyle" is used to describe a category
               of publications or programs.
